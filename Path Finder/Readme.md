# 🚀 Maze Pathfinding Visualizer

A terminal-based maze pathfinding visualizer using **Python** and **curses**, implementing **BFS (Breadth-First Search)** to find the shortest path from start (`O`) to end (`X`).  

> This project was adapted from a tutorial and enhanced through debugging, learning, and visualization improvements.

## 🎯 Features

- ✅ Visualizes a maze in the terminal  
- ✅ Shows the current path in **red**  
- ✅ Uses BFS to find the shortest path  
- ✅ Editable Python code for learning algorithms

## 🧩 Maze Symbols

- `#` → Wall  
- `O` → Start  
- `X` → End  
- ` ` → Empty space / Path

# Random Password Generator (Python)

## Overview
This is a simple **command-line random password generator** built using Python.  
The project was created as part of my learning phase to strengthen fundamentals such as functions, loops, randomness, and basic input validation.

The program generates a random password based on a user-defined length within a safe range.

## Features
- User-defined password length (5–18 characters)
- Random combination of:
  - Uppercase letters
  - Lowercase letters
  - Special characters
- Basic input validation
- Clean function-based structure

## How It Works
1. The user chooses whether to generate a password.
2. The user inputs the desired password length.
3. The program randomly selects characters and builds the password.
4. The generated password is displayed in the terminal.
